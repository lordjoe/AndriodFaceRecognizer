# AndriodFaceRecognizer
Code to recognize faces in a disconnected androin based on OpenCV and JavaCv
This code is an application written to test the capabilities of android phones and specifically cheaper phones in third world countries to perform facial recognition. It is not designed as a production app so much as a proof of concept showing that it is practical to perform facial recognition on inexpensive phones
   Anyone who wished to develop an application will need to add code for capturing images - the facial recognition part is done
